# Installing
```elisp
    (require 'nyan-prompt)
```

# Why
James J Porter showed me nyan-mode. I love nyan cat but hate scroll bars. I wanted to bring nyan-cat to my emacs so I found a middle way.

# TODO or how could it be more awesome.
* Make nyan-cat move!
* Make it a multline prompt with the rainbow taking up the folder space
* Unite with nyan-mode and see where else can we stick nyan cat in?
