# Installing
Add the following hook to your emacs conf:

```elisp
(add-hook 'eshell-load-hook 'nyan-prompt-enable)
```

# Why
James J Porter showed me nyan-mode. I love nyan cat but hate scroll bars. I wanted to bring nyan-cat to my emacs so I found a middle way.

# How could you enhance the awesomeness.
* Make nyan-cat move!
* Make it a multline prompt with the rainbow taking up the folder space
* Unite with nyan-mode and see where else can we stick nyan cat in?
